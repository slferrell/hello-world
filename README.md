My name is Sheryl. I am a graduate of Virginia Wesleyan College in Norfolk Virginia and one of my greatest passions is Shark Research and Conservation. I volunteer at the New England Aquarium every week and I love being able to open people's eyes and minds to the need there is for more ocean and environmental stewards.
